# Overwatch - Sound export
This usefool tool + tutorial gets you all the sound files extracted from the overwatch data files.

## Quick tutorial
1. Grab git contents
2. Get Tools
3. Get Python
4. Extract CASC
5. Run Python Script
6. Enjoy the sound files / contribute

### 1. Grab git contents
Just download & place in a folder of your choice.

### 2. Get Tools
This project depends on three tools.
* ww2ogg -> converts wem format to ogg. http://hcs64.com/files/ww2ogg019.zip
* revorb -> fixes ogg headers. http://yirkha.fud.cz/progs/foobar2000/revorb.exe
* casc tools -> helps us export contents from blizzard archive files. http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html

Once downloaded, place the following files directly into the tools folder:

* ww2ogg -> ww2ogg.exe
* ww2ogg -> packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin
* revorb.exe

(tools folder is projectfolder/tools)

### 3. Get Python
This project runs on Python 2.7.
Grab it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 4. Extract CASC
* Use the casc tool to open (OPEN STORAGE) Overwatch\data\casc\config\52\6a\ whatever files is in there.
* In the casc folder structure, select the folder "unknown".
* Extract the whole unknown folder to projectfolder/casc

### 5. Run Python script.
Run the main script.

It will check every exported file's header, and if it's wem format, converts it to ogg.
Checks against a list of hashes to sort the sound files.

NOTE: By default, this will not extract all files. Visit config.json and change "full_extract" from false to true to get all the ogg files.

By default the script stops after 1000 unknown sound files.

Current list has ~1000 sound files categorized. Total amount of sounds should be around 17.5k

### 6. Contribute
If you have the time, please get the next batch of audio files & categorize them.

Running the python script will generate an "unknowns.csv" file that contains all the sound files to be categorized.

NOTE: definitely leave in the 1k limit to make sure you don't get a huge csv file that your editor might not handle

db/fingerprints_noise.csv has all the files I considered non-interesting/noise

db/fingerprints_important.csv is everything else.

Structure is always the same in these two files:

hash of the file (find it in unknowns.csv) + path to place at.

you CAN rename in the fingerprints file the sound file to anything (like hanzo_pain_01.ogg). Right now please also leave in the ID you receive in the unknowns.csv (522_hanzo_pain_01.ogg or something)

You can either make a pull request for the fingerprint files if you categorized some more stuff, or send a csv file to me /u/blindmancs
