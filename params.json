{"name":"Overwatch Sound Export","tagline":"Quick guide on exporting sound files from CASC.","body":"## Quick tutorial\r\n1. Grab git contents\r\n2. Get Tools\r\n3. Get Python\r\n4. Extract CASC\r\n5. Run Python Script\r\n6. Enjoy the sound files / contribute\r\n\r\n### 1. Grab git contents\r\nJust download & place in a folder of your choice.\r\n\r\n### 2. Get Tools\r\nThis project depends on two tools.\r\n* ww2ogg -> converts wem format to ogg. http://hcs64.com/files/ww2ogg019.zip\r\n* revorb -> fixes ogg headers. http://yirkha.fud.cz/progs/foobar2000/revorb.exe\r\n* casc tools -> helps us export contents from blizzard archive files. http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded,\r\n\r\nplace ww2ogg -> ww2ogg.exe into the tools folder\r\n\r\nplace revorb.exe into the tools folder\r\n\r\n(tools folder is projectfolder/tools)\r\n\r\n### 3. Get Python\r\nThis project runs on Python 2.7.\r\nGrab it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n\r\n### 4. Extract CASC\r\n* Use the casc tool to open (OPEN STORAGE) Overwatch\\data\\casc\\config\\52\\6a\\ whatever files is there.\r\n* In the casc folder structure, select the folder \"unknown\".\r\n* Extract the whole thing to projectfolder/casc\r\n\r\n### 5. Run Python script.\r\nRun the main script.\r\n\r\nIt will check every exported file's header, and if it's wem format, converts it to ogg.\r\nChecks against a list of hashes to sort the sound files.\r\n\r\nNOTE: As of this moment, this will not extract all files. Comment line 44 & 45 to make the script convert everything to ogg.\r\n\r\nBy default the script stops after 1000 unknown sound files. (to ease building up the known sound files list)\r\n\r\nCurrent list has ~1000 sound files categorized. Total amount of sounds should be around 17.5k\r\n\r\n### 6. Contribute\r\nIf you have the time, please get the next batch of audio files & categorize them.\r\n\r\nRunning the python script will generate an \"unknowns.csv\" file that contains all the sound files to be categorized.\r\n\r\nNOTE: definitely leave in the 1k limit to make sure you don't get a huge csv file that your editor might not handle\r\n\r\ndb/fingerprints_noise.csv has all the files I considered non-interesting/noise\r\n\r\ndb/fingerprints_important.csv is everything else.\r\n\r\nStructure is always the same in these two files:\r\n\r\nhash of the file (stored in unknowns.csv) + path to place at.\r\n\r\nyou CAN rename in the fingerprints file the sound file to anything (like hanzo_pain_01.ogg). Right now please also leave in the ID you receive in the unknowns.csv (522_hanzo_pain_01.ogg or something)\r\n\r\nYou can either make a pull request for the fingerprint files if you categorized some more stuff, or send a csv file to me /u/blindmancs","google":"UA-31546636-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
